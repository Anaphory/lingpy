========

Current Version
---------------

At the moment, we are regularly updating the library, adding new features, and debugging errors.
For this reason, we don't offer an official relase at the moment. However, you can always download
our current development version from our github repository. Furthermore, we uploaded a mostly stable
version with the source code and binaries of the current state of LingPy (April 2013 version), along
with the documentation for this version.
