QLC-LingPy
==========

The library in it's current state consist of the following modules:

* algorithm - directory dedicated to specific algorithms which are mainly used program-internally
* align - basic module for the conduction of alignment analyses
* basic - basic module in which general classes are defined that are crucial for most analyses
* check - module is used to check data sources and files for consistency
* compare - basic module for the comparison of languages, dialects, doculects
* data - basic module for the handling of externally defined data (specifications of IPA, sound-class models, configuration files, name-spaces etc.)
* evaluate - module for the evaluation of algorithms (alignment, automatic cognate judgments)
* meaning - module is dedicated to semantic approaches to automatic language comparison
* read - basic module defines specific functions to read in various data types
* sequence - basic module for the handling of sequential data (most often: words)
