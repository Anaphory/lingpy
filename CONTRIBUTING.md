## Contributing

LingPy development follows the model and workflow outlined here https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/. In order to keep the code transparent even for multiple contributors, we have set up a list of coding conventions. See [here](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md) for details.
